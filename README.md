# Mathematics

This repository shows my adventures in coding mathematical models I find interesting and code when I have free time.

## Pendulum Visual

Here, the phase-space of the pendulum is show with a vector field. On the x-axis is the angle theta of the arm, and the y-axis is the angular velocity. It's pleasing to see how the vector field shows the behavior of the pendulum in an abstract way. In addition, air-resistence and gravity values can be altered that show how the vector field reacts

## Fourier Series for a Square Wave

A simple animation that shows the fourier series rotating and moving to build a square wave. It also shows how at large values of n (the amount of terms) the more accurate the drawing becomes

## Polar Equations

This animation is a simple visual on one interpretation on how polar equations relate to cartesian equations
